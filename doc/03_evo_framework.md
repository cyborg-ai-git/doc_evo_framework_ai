# Evo Framework AI
The Evo (lution) Framework is a logical structure of the media on which software can be designed and implemented which takes its inspiration from the structure of a neuronal cell.

The purpose of the framework is to provide a collection of basic entities ready for use, or reuse of code, avoiding the programmer having to rewrite every time the same functions or data structures and thus facilitating maintenance operations. This feature is therefore part of the wider context of the calling code within programs and applications and is present in almost all languages .

The main advantages of using this approach are manifold.

It can separate the programming logic of a certain application from that required for the resolution of specific problems, such as the management of collections of information transmission and reception through different communication channels.

The entities defined in a given library can be reused by multiple applications

The central part of the information model defined entity operates, the entity shall

enclosed by a layer called control, which manages and controls the flow of information open object-oriented framework.

The ability to reuse modules and classes reduce application development time and increases reliability because usually the reused code has been previously proven, tested and corrected by bugs.

The surface layer is called graphic whose job is to display and present the information contained in the entity.

The states mediator and foundation managing the storage and retrieval of entity.Il framework has branches like a tree you can receive and send messages to systems in the field through the layer bridge.
