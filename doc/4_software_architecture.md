# Software Architecture ⚙️
The Evo Framework is meticulously designed around the most advanced software engineering methodologies, incorporating:

#### SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each module and component has a singular, well-defined purpose
- Minimizes coupling between system components
- Enhances code maintainability and readability

**Open/Closed Principle**
- Components are open for extension
- Closed for direct modification
- Enables seamless feature evolution without disrupting existing implementations

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
- Robust inheritance hierarchies
- Ensures derived classes can replace base classes without system integrity loss
- Guarantees behavioral consistency across class hierarchies

**Interface Segregation Principle**
- Fine-grained, focused interfaces
- Prevents unnecessary dependencies
- Enables more modular and flexible design

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Low-level modules implement specific interfaces
- Facilitates loose coupling and improved system flexibility
