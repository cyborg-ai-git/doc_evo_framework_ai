# Architecture

![evo framework ai](data/evo_framework_text.svg)

The Evo Framework is based on different programming paradigms:
- modular programming,
- object-oriented programming,
- planning events,
- aspect-oriented programming.

The Evo Framework is divided into individual modules each of which performs specific functions in an autonomous way and that can cooperate with each other.

The goal is to simplify development, testing and maintenance of large programs that involve one or more developers.

### Multi language
The Evo Framework can be implemented in any language that supports object-oriented programming.

### Multi platform
The Evo Framework is portable and platform can be used:
- desktop environment
- server environment
- on mobile devices
- on video game consoles
- for web platforms

### Network architecture
The Evo Framework is structured so as to be able to use different types of network architecture.

- Stand-alone is capable of functioning alone or independently from other objects or software, which might otherwise interact with.
- Client-server client code contacts the server for data, which formats and displays to the user. The input data to the client are sent to the server when they are given a permanent basis.
- Architecture 3-tier th system moves the intelligence of the client at an intermediate level so that the client without state can be used. This simplifies the movement of applications. Most web applications are 3-Tier.
- N-Tier Architecture – N-Tier refers typically to web applications that send their requests to other services.
- Tight-coupled (clustered) – It usually refers to a cluster of machines working together running a shared process in parallel.
- The task is divided into parts that are processed individually by each and then sent back together to form the final result.
- Peer-to-peer networks – architecture where there are special machines that provide a service or manage the network resources. Instead all responsibilities are uniformly divided among all machines known as peers. The peer can act both as a client and a server.
- Space-based – Refers to a structure that creates the illusion (virtualization) of a single address space. The data is replicated according to application requirements.
