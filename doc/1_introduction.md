# Introduction

The neuron is the unit cell that constitutes the nervous issue.

Thanks to its peculiar chemical and physiological properties is able to receive, integrate and transmit nerve impulses, as well as to produce substances called neuro secreted. From the cell body origin have cytoplasmic extensions, said neurites, which are the dendrites and the axon. The dendrites, which have branches like a tree, receive signals from afferent neurons and propagate centripetally. The complexity of the dendritic tree represents one of the main determinants of neuronal morphology and of the number of signals received from the neuron. Unlike the axon dendrites are not good conductors of nerve signals which tend to decrease in intensity. In addition, the dendrites become thinner to the end point and contain polyribosomes. The axon conducts instead the signal to other cells in a centrifugal direction. It has a uniform diameter and is an excellent conductor thanks to the layers of myelin. In the axon of certain neuronal protein synthesis may occur in neurotransmitters, proteins and mitochondrial cargo. The final part of the axon is an expansion of said button terminal. Through an axon terminal buttons can contact the dendrites or cell bodies of other neurons so that the nerve impulse is propagated along a neuronal circuit.
