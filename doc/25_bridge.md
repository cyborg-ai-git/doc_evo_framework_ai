The Post Quantum Cryptographic Entity System (PQCES) is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate secure, authenticated communication in distributed peer-to-peer networks. Built from the ground up with quantum-resistance in mind, this system leverages NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to establish a future-proof security architecture. PQCE implements a hierarchical trust model with specialized cryptographic roles, robust certificate management, and defense-in-depth security measures to protect against both classical and quantum threats. This system is particularly suitable for applications requiring long-term security assurances, distributed trust, and resilient communication channels in potentially hostile network environments.
PQCES.
This cryptographic architecture provides a quantum-resistant foundation for distributed systems communication, combining NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms with robust protocol design. The system enables secure peer authentication, confidential data exchange, and scalable trust management through three core mechanisms:
- **Hierarchical Trust** via certificate-chained identities
- **Layered Cryptography** combining PQ KEM and symmetric encryption
- **Defense-in-Depth** through multiple verification stages

The design emphasizes maintainability through modular cryptographic primitives and provides comprehensive protection against both classical and quantum computing threats. Future enhancements would focus on automated key rotation and distributed trust mechanisms.

By implementing this system in accordance with NIST guidelines and recommendations, organizations can establish a cryptographic foundation that meets current security standards while remaining resistant to future quantum computing attacks.

## Technical Overview
This document describes a post-quantum cryptographic system designed for secure peer-to-peer communication in distributed networks. The architecture employs a hierarchical trust model with specialized cryptographic roles and modern NIST-standardized algorithms.\pagebreak
## CIA Triad Implementation

The Cryptographic Entity Management System is designed with the foundational principles of information security - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) - as core architectural considerations. Each element of the CIA triad is addressed through specific cryptographic mechanisms and protocol designs.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized entities and is protected from disclosure to unauthorized parties.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** Kyber-1024 key encapsulation mechanism provides post-quantum protection for key exchange, ensuring confidentiality even against quantum computing attacks.

- **Strong Symmetric Encryption:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption with unique per-packet nonces secures all data in transit.

- **Layered Encryption Model:** Session keys derived from KEM exchanges provide an additional layer of confidentiality protection.

- **Private Key Protection:**
  - Master Peer private keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
  - Peer private keys never transmitted across the network
  - Key material access strictly controlled

- **Certificate Privacy:** Certificate retrieval requires authenticated sessions, preventing unauthorized access to identity information.

**Confidentiality Assurance Level:** The system provides NIST Level 5 protection (highest NIST security level) against both classical and quantum adversaries.

### Integrity

Integrity ensures that information is accurate, complete, and has not been modified by unauthorized entities.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Digital Signatures:** Dilithium-5 signatures provide quantum-resistant integrity protection for certificates and critical communications.

- **Message Authentication:** Poly1305 message authentication code (MAC) validates the integrity of each encrypted packet.

- **Certificate Chain Validation:** Comprehensive validation of certificate chains ensures the integrity of peer identities.

- **Hash Algorithm Options:** Multiple hash algorithm options (BLAKE3) for identity derivation and integrity validation.

- **Integrity Proofs:** SHA-512/256 integrity proofs included in certificate packages and critical communications.

- **Monotonic Counters:** EAction headers include monotonic counters to prevent message replay or reordering attacks.

**Integrity Verification Process:**
1. Signature verification using Master Peer's public key
2. Certificate chain validation
3. Message authentication code verification
4. Integrity proof validation
5. Counter and nonce validation

### Availability

Availability ensures that authorized users have reliable and timely access to information and resources.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Distributed Certificate Registry:** Certificate information distributed across GitHub repositories and IPFS ensures high availability even if individual nodes fail.

- **Decentralized Trust Model:** Master Peer architecture can be extended to multiple Master Peers for redundancy.

- **Robust Protocol Design:** Communication protocols designed to handle network interruptions and reconnections gracefully.

- **Certificate Caching:** Peers can cache validated certificates to continue operations during temporary Master Peer unavailability.

- **Protocol Resilience:** Automatic session rekeying and reconnection capabilities maintain availability during network disruptions.

- **Denial of Service Protection:**
  - Computational puzzles can be integrated to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
  - Rate limiting mechanisms prevent flooding attacks
  - Authentication required before resource-intensive operations

**Availability Enhancement Features:**
- Emergency certificate revocation via Online Certificate Status Protocol Plus Plus (OCSPP)
- Historical key maintenance for continued validation of legacy communications
- Peer recovery mechanisms after temporary disconnection

### CIA Triad Balance

The system maintains a careful balance between the three elements of the CIA triad:

- **Confidentiality vs Availability Trade-offs:** Strong authentication requirements enhance confidentiality but are designed with fallback mechanisms to maintain availability during disruptions.

- **Integrity vs Performance Balance:** Comprehensive integrity verification is optimized for minimal latency impact.

- **Security Level Customization:** The system allows selection of cryptographic parameters based on specific confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.\pagebreak

## Protocol Flow Diagrams

### Certificate Issuance Sequence

```
[PeerA]                    [Master Peer]
|--- AKE Request ----------->|
|<-- Session Confirm --------|
|--- Api request  ---------->| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
|<-- PeerA Certificate ------| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
```
![sequence_diagram_0.svg](data/sequence_diagram_0.svg)
\pagebreak

### Secure Messaging Sequence

#### Case 1: Certificate Retrieval and Direct Communication
First, PeerB requests PeerA's certificate from the Master Peer:

```
[PeerB]                    [Master Peer]
|--- AKE Request ----------->|
|<-- Session Confirm --------|
|--- Api request  ---------->| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
|<-- PeerA Certificate ------| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
```
![sequence_diagram_1.svg](data/sequence_diagram_1.svg)
\pagebreak
Then, direct communication between PeerB and PeerA occurs:

```
[PeerB]                    [PeerA]
|--- AKE Request ----------->|
|<-- Session Confirm --------|
|--- Api request  ---------->| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
|<-- Encrypted Response -----|  <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
```
![sequence_diagram_1_1.svg](data/sequence_diagram_1_1.svg)
\pagebreak
#### Case 2: Direct Communication
Direct communication between PeerB and PeerA when certificate is already available:

```
[PeerB]                     [PeerA]
|--- AKE Request ----------->|
|<-- Session Confirm --------|
|--- Api request  ---------->| <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
|<-- Encrypted Response -----|  <- Each packet with unique ChaCha20 nonce
```

  \pagebreak
## Certificate Pinning and Trust Anchors

### Master Peer Certificate Pinning

The system implements robust certificate pinning to establish an immutable trust anchor, mitigating man-in-the-middle and certificate substitution attacks.

#### Embedded Certificates

![d4.svg](data/d4.svg)

All peers in the network have the Master Peer's cryptographic certificates embedded directly within their software or firmware:

- **Kyber-1024 Public Certificate:** Embedded as a hardcoded constant, providing the quantum-resistant encryption trust anchor
- **Dilithium-5 Public Certificate:** Embedded to verify all Master Peer signatures, establishing signature validation trust
- **Certificate Fingerprints:** SHA3-256 fingerprints of both certificates stored for integrity verification

#### Security Benefits

![d6.svg](data/d6.svg)

This certificate pinning approach provides several critical security advantages:

- **Trust Establishment:** Creates an unambiguous trust anchor independent of certificate authorities
- **MITM Prevention:** Prevents interception attacks during initial bootstrapping and connection
- **Compromise Resistance:** Makes malicious certificate substitution attacks infeasible, even if network infrastructure is compromised
- **Offline Verification:** Enables certificate chain validation without active network connectivity
- **Quantum-Resistant Trust:** Ensures trust roots maintain security properties against quantum adversaries
- **Implementation follows NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 recommendations for certificate validation**

#### Implementation Requirements

The embedded certificates are protected with the following measures:

- **Tamper Protection:** Implemented with software security controls to prevent modification
- **Verification During Updates:** Certificate fingerprints verified during any software/firmware updates
- **Backup Verification Paths:** Alternative verification methods available if primary verification fails
- **Multiple Storage Locations:** Redundant certificate storage prevents single-point failure

#### Emergency Certificate Rotation

![d5.svg](data/d5.svg)

In the rare case of Master Peer key compromise, the system supports secure certificate rotation:

- Multi-signature approval process required for accepting new Master certificates
- Out-of-band verification channels established for certificate rotation
- Tiered approach to certificate acceptance based on threshold signatures
- Follows NIST SP 800-57 guidelines for cryptographic key transition
## Memory Management and Session Security

### Connection State Management

#### Master Peer Memory Optimization

![d7.svg](data/d7.svg)

The Master Peer implements efficient memory management by maintaining only essential connection information in active memory:

- **Minimalist Connection Map:** Only stores the 32-byte TypeID and current shared secret key for active connections
- **Resource Release:** Automatically releases memory for inactive connections after timeout periods
- **Connection Lifecycle Management:** Implements state transition monitoring to ensure proper resource cleanup
- **Serialized Persistence:** Only critical authentication data is persisted to storage; ephemeral session data remains in memory only

This approach significantly reduces the memory footprint, particularly in high-connection-volume environments, while maintaining necessary security context for active communications.

#### Peer Connection Caching

![d9.svg](data/d9.svg)

Regular Peers implement similar memory optimization strategies:

- **Limited Connection Cache:** Maintains only active connection information (32-byte TypeID and shared key)
- **Selective Persistence:** Only stores long-term cryptographic identities and certificates on disk
- **Memory-Efficient Design:** Session keys and temporary cryptographic material held in secure memory regions
- **Garbage Collection:** Automated cleanup processes reclaim memory from expired sessions

### Dynamic Session Security

#### Secret Renegotiation Protocol

![d8.svg](data/d8.svg)

To enhance forward secrecy and mitigate passive monitoring, the system implements dynamic session renegotiation:

- **Random Renegotiation Triggers:**
  - Time-based: Session keys renegotiated after configurable intervals (default: 1 hour)
  - Random-based: Spontaneous renegotiation initiated with 0.1% probability per message exchange

- **Renegotiation Process:**
  - Initiated via special EAction type
  - New Kyber KEM exchange performed within existing encrypted channel
  - Seamless key transition without communication interruption
  - Previous session keys securely erased from memory

- **Security Benefits:**
  - Minimizes effective cryptographic material available to attackers
  - Provides continual forward secrecy guarantees
  - Creates moving target defense against cryptanalysis attempts
  - Follows NIST SP 800-57 recommendations for cryptoperiod management
