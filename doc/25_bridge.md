The **Post Quantum Cryptographic Entity System (PQCES)** is a bridge layer of **Evo Framework AI**  designed to facilitate secure, authenticated communication in distributed peer-to-peer networks. Built from the ground up with quantum-resistance in mind, this system leverages NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to establish a future-proof security architecture. **PQCES** implements a hierarchical trust model with specialized cryptographic roles, robust certificate management, and defense-in-depth security measures to protect against both classical and quantum threats. This system is particularly suitable for applications requiring long-term security assurances, distributed trust, and resilient communication channels in potentially hostile network environments.
**PQCES**.
This cryptographic architecture provides a quantum-resistant foundation for distributed systems communication, combining NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms with robust protocol design. The system enables secure peer authentication, confidential data exchange, and scalable trust management through three core mechanisms:

## Technical Overview
This document describes a post-quantum cryptographic system designed for secure peer-to-peer communication in distributed networks. The architecture employs a hierarchical trust model with specialized cryptographic roles and modern NIST-standardized algorithms.

## Bridge Entities

The **Evo Bridge PQCES** architecture is built upon four fundamental cryptographic entities that work together to provide secure, quantum-resistant peer-to-peer communication. Each entity serves a specific role in the distributed trust model and cryptographic protocol stack.

### Virtual IPv6 Architecture (VIP6)

#### Decentralized Identity System

The peer **ID** functions as a secure, decentralized addressing system that provides several advantages over traditional networking.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Unlike IPv6, the ID doesn't expose physical network location or infrastructure details
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Derived from public key material, making spoofing computationally infeasible
- **Location-Independent**: Peers can migrate between networks, cloud providers, or devices without changing identity
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Single identity works across multiple transport mechanisms

**Supported Transport Protocols:**
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication for web applications
- **WebRTC**: Direct peer-to-peer communication with NAT traversal
- **Raw TCP/UDP**: Low-level protocols for maximum performance
- **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Modern web protocols with multiplexing capabilities
- **EvoQuic** *(Coming Soon)*: Custom quantum-resistant protocol optimized for PQCES

#### Blockchain-Based Decentralization

The identity system leverages blockchain technology to achieve true decentralization.

**Decentralization Benefits:**
- **Infrastructure Independence**: No reliance on centralized DNS or certificate authorities
- **Global Accessibility**: Peer identities remain valid across different network infrastructures
- **Censorship Resistance**: Distributed identity resolution prevents single points of control
- **Migration Flexibility**: Seamless movement between hosting providers including local development environments, cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), edge computing providers (Fly.io, Cloudflare Workers), AI/ML platforms (HuggingFace, Google Colab), and decentralized hosting (IPFS, Arweave)

**Identity Resolution Process:**
1. **Peer Discovery**: Query Master Peer or distributed registry with target peer ID
2. **Certificate Retrieval**: Obtain authenticated EPeerCertificate for the target peer
3. **Capability Negotiation**: Determine optimal transport protocol and connection parameters
4. **Secure Connection**: Establish quantum-resistant encrypted channel using retrieved public keys

This architecture enables a truly decentralized, secure, and flexible communication system where peers can maintain persistent identities while adapting to changing network conditions and infrastructure requirements.

## CIA Triad Implementation

The Cryptographic Entity Management System is designed with the foundational principles of information security - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) - as core architectural considerations. Each element of the CIA triad is addressed through specific cryptographic mechanisms and protocol designs.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized entities and is protected from disclosure to unauthorized parties.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** Kyber-1024 key encapsulation mechanism provides post-quantum protection for key exchange, ensuring confidentiality even against quantum computing attacks.

- **Strong Symmetric Encryption:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption with unique per-packet nonces secures all data in transit.

- **Layered Encryption Model:** Session keys derived from KEM exchanges provide an additional layer of confidentiality protection.

- **Private Key Protection:**
  - Master Peer private keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
  - Peer private keys never transmitted across the network
  - Key material access strictly controlled

- **Certificate Privacy:** Certificate retrieval requires authenticated sessions, preventing unauthorized access to identity information.

**Confidentiality Assurance Level:** The system provides NIST Level 5 protection (highest NIST security level) against both classical and quantum adversaries.

### Integrity

Integrity ensures that information is accurate, complete, and has not been modified by unauthorized entities.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Digital Signatures:** Dilithium-5 signatures provide quantum-resistant integrity protection for certificates and critical communications.

- **Message Authentication:** Poly1305 message authentication code (MAC) validates the integrity of each encrypted packet.

- **Certificate Chain Validation:** Comprehensive validation of certificate chains ensures the integrity of peer identities.

- **Hash Algorithm Options:** Multiple hash algorithm options (BLAKE3) for identity derivation and integrity validation.

- **Integrity Proofs:** SHA-256/512 integrity proofs included in certificate packages and critical communications.

- **Monotonic Counters:** EAction headers include monotonic counters to prevent message replay or reordering attacks.

**Integrity Verification Process:**
1. Signature verification using Master Peer's public key
2. Certificate chain validation
3. Message authentication code verification
4. Integrity proof validation
5. Counter and nonce validation

### Availability

Availability ensures that authorized users have reliable and timely access to information and resources.

**Implementation Mechanisms:**

- **Distributed Certificate Registry:** Certificate information are now distributed across GitHub repositories and IPFS (soon will migrate to EvoDPQ) ensures high availability even if individual nodes fail.

- **Decentralized Trust Model:** Master Peer architecture can be extended to multiple Master Peers for redundancy.

- **Robust Protocol Design:** Communication protocols designed to handle network interruptions and reconnections gracefully.

- **Certificate Caching:** Peers can cache validated certificates to continue operations during temporary Master Peer unavailability or direct coneection Peer to Peer.

- **Protocol Resilience:** Automatic session rekeying and reconnection capabilities maintain availability during network disruptions.

- **Denial of Service Protection:**
  - Computational puzzles can be integrated to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
  - Rate limiting mechanisms prevent flooding attacks
  - Authentication required before resource-intensive operations

**Availability Enhancement Features:**
- Emergency certificate revocation via Online Certificate Status Protocol Plus Plus (OCSPP)
- Historical key maintenance for continued validation of legacy communications
- Peer recovery mechanisms after temporary disconnection

### CIA Triad Balance

The system maintains a careful balance between the three elements of the CIA triad:

- **Confidentiality vs Availability Trade-offs:** Strong authentication requirements enhance confidentiality but are designed with fallback mechanisms to maintain availability during disruptions.

- **Integrity vs Performance Balance:** Comprehensive integrity verification is optimized for minimal latency impact.

- **Security Level Customization:** The system allows selection of cryptographic parameters based on specific confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.

## **PQCES** Protocol Flow Diagrams

### Certificate Issuance Sequence (api: set_peer)

```
[PeerA]                                     [Master Peer]
|--------- AKE Request + EPeerPublic + sign ----------->| 
|<-------- PeerA Certificate (Master Peer signed) ------|
```

![bridge set_peer](data/bridge_set_peer_mp.svg)

---

### Secure Messaging Sequence (api:get peer)

#### Case 1: Certificate Retrieval and Direct Communication
First, PeerB requests PeerA's certificate from the Master Peer because don't have PeerA in cache:

```
[PeerB]                                     [Master Peer]
|--------- AKE Request + PeerA ID --------------------->|
|<-------- PeerA Certificate (Master Peer signed) ------|

```
![bridge get_peer](data/bridge_get_peer_mp.svg)

---

Then, direct communication between PeerB and PeerA occurs:
```
[PeerB]                                           [PeerA]
|--------- AKE Request + PeerB ID + Api Request ------->| (PeerA get certificate of PeerB (case 1/2) )
|<-- Encrypted Response with new Secret Key ------------|
```
![bridge direct case 1](data/bridge_direct_1.svg)

\pagebreak

#### Case 2: Direct Communication
Direct communication between PeerB and PeerA when certificate is already available (from cache or other secure channel):

```
[PeerB]                                           [PeerA]
|--------- AKE Request + PeerB ID + Api Request ------->|
|<-- Encrypted Response with new Secret Key ------------|
```
![bridge direct case 2](data/bridge_direct_2.svg)

---

#### Case Revoke: Revoke Certificate (api: del_peer)
If at least PeerA's secret_kyber and secret_dilithium keys are compromised, the peer is no longer safe and must revoke the peer certificate so other peers know not to use the certificate, and PeerA becomes untrusted:

```
[PeerA]                                                      [Master Peer]
|--------- AKE Request + PeerA ID + Sign with compromized secret ------->|
|<-- Encrypted EApiResult Response --------------------------------------|
```
![bridge revoke](data/bridge_del_peer_mp.svg)

## Certificate Pinning and Trust Anchors

### Master Peer Certificate Pinning

The system implements robust certificate pinning to establish an immutable trust anchor, mitigating man-in-the-middle and certificate substitution attacks.

#### Embedded Certificates


All peers in the network have the Master Peer's cryptographic certificates embedded directly within their software or firmware:

- **Kyber-1024 Public Certificate:** Embedded as a hardcoded constant, providing the quantum-resistant encryption trust anchor
- **Dilithium-5 Public Certificate:** Embedded to verify all Master Peer signatures, establishing signature validation trust
- **Certificate Fingerprints:** SHA-256 fingerprints of both certificates stored for integrity verification

#### Security Benefits

This certificate pinning approach provides several critical security advantages:

- **Trust Establishment:** Creates an unambiguous trust anchor independent of certificate authorities
- **MITM Prevention:** Prevents interception attacks during initial bootstrapping and connection
- **Compromise Resistance:** Makes malicious certificate substitution attacks infeasible, even if network infrastructure is compromised
- **Offline Verification:** Enables certificate chain validation without active network connectivity
- **Quantum-Resistant Trust:** Ensures trust roots maintain security properties against quantum adversaries
- **Implementation follows NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 recommendations for certificate validation**

#### Implementation Requirements

The embedded certificates are protected with the following measures:

- **Tamper Protection:** Implemented with software security controls to prevent modification
- **Verification During Updates:** Certificate fingerprints verified during any software/firmware updates
- **Backup Verification Paths:** Alternative verification methods available if primary verification fails
- **Multiple Storage Locations:** Redundant certificate storage prevents single-point failure

#### Emergency Certificate Rotation


In the rare case of Master Peer key compromise, the system supports secure certificate rotation:

- Multi-signature approval process required for accepting new Master certificates
- Out-of-band verification channels established for certificate rotation
- Tiered approach to certificate acceptance based on threshold signatures
- Follows NIST SP 800-57 guidelines for cryptographic key transition

## Memory Management and Session Security

### Connection State Management

#### Master Peer Memory Optimization


The Master Peer implements efficient memory management by maintaining only essential connection information in active memory:

- **Minimalist Connection Map:** Only stores the 32-byte TypeID and current shared secret key for active connections
- **Resource Release:** Automatically releases memory for inactive connections after timeout periods
- **Connection Lifecycle Management:** Implements state transition monitoring to ensure proper resource cleanup
- **Serialized Persistence:** Only critical authentication data is persisted to storage; ephemeral session data remains in memory only

This approach significantly reduces the memory footprint, particularly in high-connection-volume environments, while maintaining necessary security context for active communications.

#### Peer Connection Caching


Regular Peers implement similar memory optimization strategies:

- **Limited Connection Cache:** Maintains only active connection information (32-byte TypeID and shared key)
- **Selective Persistence:** Only stores long-term cryptographic identities and certificates on disk
- **Memory-Efficient Design:** Session keys and temporary cryptographic material held in secure memory regions
- **Garbage Collection:** Automated cleanup processes reclaim memory from expired sessions

### Dynamic Session Security

#### Secret Renegotiation Protocol

To enhance forward secrecy and mitigate passive monitoring, the system implements dynamic session renegotiation:

- **Random Renegotiation Triggers:**
  - Time-based: Secret session keys renegotiated after configurable intervals (default: 1 hour)
  - Random-based: Spontaneous renegotiation initiated with 0.1% probability per message exchange

- **Renegotiation Process:**
  - Initiated via special EApiEvent type
  - New Kyber KEM exchange performed within existing encrypted channel
  - Seamless key transition without communication interruption
  - Previous session keys securely erased from memory

- **Security Benefits:**
  - Minimizes effective cryptographic material available to attackers
  - Provides continual forward secrecy guarantees
  - Creates moving target defense against cryptanalysis attempts
  - Follows NIST SP 800-57 recommendations for cryptoperiod management
