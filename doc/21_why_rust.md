# Why Rust? ðŸ¦€

The Evo Framework is fundamentally implemented in Rust, a systems programming language that combines:
- Extreme performance comparable to C
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Native support for concurrent and parallel computing
- Comprehensive compile-time guarantees

### Performance Considerations

Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on slow serialization methods like JSON or Protocol Buffers, Evo implements a custom zero-copy serialization mechanism that:
- Eliminates runtime serialization overhead
- Provides near-native performance
- Ensures type-safe data transmission
- Minimizes memory allocations

#### Language Performance Critique

The framework acknowledges the performance limitations of certain languages:
- Python: Interpreted, global interpreter lock (GIL) limitations
- Node.js: Single-threaded event loop, inefficient for complex computations
- JavaScript: Garbage collection overhead

In contrast, Rust offers:
- Compiled performance matching C
- Safe concurrency
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Predictable memory management

**Cross-Platform Architecture:**
- Write core business logic in Rust only one time for all platforms  (IControl, IEntity, IBridge, and IMemory)
- Use platform-native UI layers IGui for specific platform (SwiftUI, Jetpack compose, Unity, Unreal, Wasm, React, Svelte...) 

## Key Takeaways

**For Memory Safety**: Rust provides the best memory safety without garbage collection overhead. Java, Kotlin, and C# offer good memory safety with GC trade-offs.

**For Security**: Rust leads in compile-time security guarantees. Languages with strong type systems (Kotlin, Swift, C#) offer good runtime security.

**For Threading**: Rust and Kotlin (coroutines) excel in modern concurrency. C# has excellent async support. Avoid Python. Node.js for CPU-bound multithreading.

**For Mobile Development**:
- **Android**: Java and Kotlin are native choices. C/C++ via NDK for performance-critical components. Rust via JNI/FFI for high-performance libraries.
- **iOS**: Swift is the native choice, with excellent performance and platform integration. Rust can be integrated via FFI for shared business logic.
- **Cross-platform Mobile**: React Native (JavaScript/React), Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, C# with Xamarin/MAUI, or Rust with platform-specific UI layers.

**Mobile-Specific Considerations**:
- Native development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin/Java for Android) provides best performance and platform integration
- Rust offers excellent mobile FFI support: can compile to iOS frameworks and Android libraries with C ABI
- Cross-platform solutions trade some performance for development efficiency
- Rust mobile approach: shared core logic in Rust with platform-specific UI (SwiftUI/Jetpack Compose)
- Hybrid approaches (React Native, Flutter alternatives) offer good balance of performance and code reuse
